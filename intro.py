    st.markdown("""
    In this study, we implemented two key AI models for the digital banking system:

    - **Facial Recognition Model** (for **KYC (Know Your Customer)** and **identity verification**)  
      Ensures the authenticity of user identities, preventing malicious account registration and unauthorized access.  

    - **Fraud Transaction Detection Model**  
      Leverages AI to identify suspicious transactions and protect digital banking users from financial fraud.
